        be able to explain the situation to you better then I.
      - Come on, let's get going before this place crumbles from old age I'll tag
        along, roads these days aren't very safe.

        in it are still active so weren't able to approach it.
      - I might know how and why you found yourself there, but I can't quite trust
        you yet as I don't know you. Tell you what, you help out the village and I
        will tell you.

        and kill few of the spiders in the forest and bring their silk, we use it
        to craft bandages.

      DialogLines:
      - Well done, I guess you are trustworthy after all.
      - As promised I will tell you what I know. I believe you are an Argonaut. A
        hero summoned to this world in order to save it.
      - You being able to use the magic is proof on its own. See, magic in this world
        is tainted by evil creatures, therefore any humans that would use it would
        go insane or die.
      - We are not quite sure what taint is, but we know it is another essence that
        is mixed with pure magic, like poison.
      - There are few places in this world we call Source Wells. As the name suggests
        those places are source of magical essence.
      - One those places happens to be the Temple where you woke up. I believe there
        might be a way to purify the source here on Quiox.
      - Taint is spread by creatures we call Harbringers. One of those is the dragon
        called Terrorbringer.
      - He is terrorizing the sky island for awhile now, but thanks to the Temple
        and the Divines there is a barrier around the village that prevents him from
        destroying it for now.
      - He made his lair under the portal that leads to the mainland. So if you want
        to find out more about yourself and your purpose you will need to defeat him
        in order to go through the portal. Defeating him means opening the passage
        once again.
